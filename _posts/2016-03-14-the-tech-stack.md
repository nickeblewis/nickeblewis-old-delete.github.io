## Unraveling the tech stack
If technology were paper, my office would be a messy place, there would be stacks of the stuff all over the floor, my desks, shelves, cupboards would be brimming with it all. Where did I leave React, it's somewhere over here in the corner buried under a pile of Jekyll and Wordpress stuff. 

You get the gist, trying to stay on top of it all is a challenge at times but I think it's a good one to have. In fact so good I'm able to make a living out of it, helping other people make the right choices and it is very much the reason headforcode.com exists. 

Which is the right thing to use? Well there isn't one! Haha!

Joking aside there are good and bad choices to make but this all depends on you or your client. What is the right stack for the project. Are you more of JS than a Ruby person? Where do you feel most comfortable? Do you really need to reinvent the wheel for this new project?

I'm writing this because I've been there and I keep on returning to the same spot, sometimes as if I were driving around an unfamiliar city and kept taking the wrong turnings. You know the ones where you keep on finding yourself at the same roundabout. How do I get out of here?, you scream in your head. 

So with H4C as Head for Code will be known for short, we shall be taking a look at many things along the way and all relevant in this business right now. 

Take for example Static Websites which this one is and we've based it on Jeylll. I deliberated for days over what tool I should use to make it happen. 

Opted for Jekyll

Netlify

I could have chosen Hugo or Roots?

Well I do know both Ruby and JS but know nothing about GoLang

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
