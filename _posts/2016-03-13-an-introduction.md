## Introducing Head for Code (H4C)

It all began with a contract consultancy way back in 2001 and that very business is still ticking over today, it has had some interesting times along the way, it has been exposed to all kinds of business environments and a wealth of different technologies. It has learnt a lot of lessons, some good and some bad. It has very much focussed on one key area, that being the Web and in more recent years the rapidly growing phenomena of the responsive web app. So it is has to be said, that a lot of stuff has been learnt and now we feel that it is as good a time as any to begin teaching both our future generations and seasoned professionals equally, how to use these skills and at the same time to make sense of it all.

So it was these thoughts and notions that lead me to come up with "Head for Code" or H4C for short!

H4C is both a business idea and a website, the latter you have here, right in front of your eyes, is built using Jekyll which is built on top of the great Ruby-on-Rails programming language, one of the topics we shall cover here. 

Before we teach new technologies, we spend quite a lot of time working with them, trying to figure out how they work and above all else, how they can be used in the real world. That is not to say that we abandon the good old fundamentals of the web! We want H4C to be a very well rounded resource for people ranging from students to apprentices and from Junior Developers to Senior Developers. So the whole spectrum shall be covered here.

The Blog will feature frequent content and it is here where we shall begin building up this site. We quite literally will document it's development, the tools that we have used to build it and why. We hope that from the blog, you shall learn some stuff, as I am sure that we will.

### Other things we will be considering for the future..

We will even be looking at running one-to-one tuition at some point in the future but that is a long way off for the moment.
